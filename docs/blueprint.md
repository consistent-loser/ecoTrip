## Core Features:

- Hotel Search: Allow users to search for hotels using a search bar connected to the Booking.com API.
- Simulated Booking: Simulate booking the hotel from our side after the user confirms. Since this is an MVP, actual booking functionality won't be implemented.

- Trips Page: A trips page that shows upcoming trips and past trips.
- Calendar Filter: A calender filter.
